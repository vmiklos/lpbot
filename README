= IRC bot
Miklos Vajna <vmiklos@vmiklos.hu>

== Specification

=== Functions

My aim is to create an IRC bot, with the following minimal features:

* automatic parallel connections to multiple servers, and to multiple
  channels within a server, automatic reconnect on network errors

* authentication of users (with password and/or using services available
  on the network)

* implementation of a simple wiki-like database, users with sufficient
  privileges can create records (storing creation and modification time
  for each record, storing old versions as well)

* controlling the bot via a tcp port: users with sufficient privileges
  can connect to the bot using a utility program and can control it to
  execute given commands (for example connect to a new server if the bot
  is not connected to any server)

* other extra nice features: RSS reader (announces the link of new
  entries to a given channel), sending forgotten password via e-mail.

=== Papers

* the IRC bot itself (`lpbot`), ran by the administrator

* the utility controller program (`lpbotctl`), run by the users with
  sufficient privileges

* administrator guide

* user guide

* developer guide

== User guide

The following features are available for a user:

* automatic parallel connect to multiple servers
* automatic join to multiple channels, if the connect was successful
* automatic reconnect on network error (ping timeout, read/write error)

* commands are available via the public channel (via highlight) or in a
  private query as well

* `identify` command, it requires no more parameters in case using
  services, or requires one password parameter if configured to use
  password authentication

* `db` command, it has 3 subcommands: `db get title` to query an
  existing record, `db put title text here` to insert a new record or
  update an existing one and `db del title` to delete a record.

* the bot binds to port 1100 and you can access the commands via telnet
  as well (the syntax is `<login> PRIVMSG lpbot <command>`)

* `connect` command to connect to a new server:
  `connect test localhost 6667 lpbot2 #lpbot_local`

* you can configure rss feeds in the config and the bot announces the
  new entries on the configured channels from time to time (interval can
  be set via the `rss_interval` option).

* the `remind` command will send your password to your email address.

* the `lpbotctl` utility can be used to control the bot once it is
  disconnected from all servers. usage: `lpbotctl [user] [host] [port]`.
  it defaults to the current system user name, localhost and 1100,
  respectively.

* there are few commands in addition to the ones which were described in
  the specification: the `ping` command replies with a `pong`, and the
  `eval <command>` parameter is available for administrators to make the
  bot execute any IRC command.
